# INSTRUCTIONS: This file contains representations of each Load Serving Entity
# (LSE). LSEs are identified by their standard abbreviation, followed by a
# list of known aliases such the full name or alternative abbreviations. When
# the ra_reports script detects the name given in a monthly report does not
# match any known aliases, the alias should be added to the appropriate list.
# Similarly, if and when a new LSE begins submitting reports, it should be
# added as a new item with its own list of likely aliases.
